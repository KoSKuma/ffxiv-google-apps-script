# Google Apps Script Development Rules

## Project Structure
- Use `.gs` extension for Google Apps Script files
- Use `.html` extension for HTML dialog/sidebar files
- Organize code into logical modules (one file per module/feature)
- Keep main entry points in `Code.gs` or `Main.gs`
- Use descriptive file names that reflect their purpose

## Code Style
- Follow JavaScript ES5/ES6 best practices (Apps Script supports modern JS)
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var` when possible
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Prefer async/await over callbacks for asynchronous operations
- Use JSDoc comments for function documentation
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Google Apps Script Specific
- Always handle errors with try-catch blocks
- Use `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()` for active spreadsheet operations
- Cache frequently accessed data (ranges, values) to improve performance
- Use batch operations (getValues/setValues) instead of cell-by-cell operations
- Be mindful of execution time limits (6 minutes for regular scripts)
- Use triggers appropriately (onEdit, onOpen, time-driven, etc.)
- Always request minimal necessary permissions

## Best Practices
- Separate business logic from UI code
- Use configuration objects for settings instead of hardcoding values
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use `Logger.log()` for debugging (remove before production)
- Consider using `console.log()` for better debugging experience
- Document API calls and external dependencies
- Use meaningful constants for magic numbers and strings
- Implement input validation for user-facing functions

## File Organization
- Keep utility functions in separate files (e.g., `Utils.gs`, `Helpers.gs`)
- Group related functions together
- Use namespaces or object literals to organize related code
- Keep HTML templates in separate `.html` files

## Testing
- Create test functions for critical logic
- Use descriptive test function names (e.g., `testCalculateTotal`)
- Comment out or remove test code before deployment

## Deployment
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, tokens, etc.)
- Use Script Properties for configuration that shouldn't be in code
- Document deployment steps in README
- Version your code appropriately

## Performance
- Minimize calls to SpreadsheetApp methods (cache results)
- Use batch operations whenever possible
- Avoid nested loops when working with large datasets
- Consider using Apps Script's built-in array methods (map, filter, reduce)

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before writing to sheets
- Use appropriate permission scopes
- Never log sensitive information

## Documentation Maintenance
- **CRITICAL**: Update markdown documentation files when making significant changes
- When adding new functions: Update `API.md` with function documentation
- When adding new features: Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` with module information
- When changing workflows: Update `DEVELOPMENT.md` with new processes
- When modifying code style: Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.cursorrules`
- When adding new patterns: Update `PROMPTS.md` with examples
- Keep `README.md` up to date with project structure and setup instructions
- **Task Tracking**: Update `TODO.md` when completing tasks, adding new features, or identifying work items
  - Mark completed tasks as ✅ and move to "Completed Tasks" section
  - Add new tasks to appropriate sections (Current Sprint, Planned Features, Technical Debt, etc.)
  - Update task status (⬜ Not Started, 🟡 In Progress, ✅ Completed, ❌ Cancelled)
- Documentation should reflect the current state of the codebase
- If AI assistants are used, ensure they update relevant documentation files including `TODO.md`
- Review documentation accuracy during code reviews
